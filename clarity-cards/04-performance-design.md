# Performance Design: Why Monad Is Fast

Monad’s performance comes from three pillars:

### 1. Parallel Execution  
Runs transactions simultaneously when safe.

### 2. Deterministic Scheduling  
Allows predictable execution ordering and reduces latency spikes.

### 3. Optimized EVM Implementation  
Low-level engineering improvements yield:
- Lower overhead
- Faster state access
- Efficient memory operations

### Why This Matters to Builders
You can design applications that assume:
- Higher TPS
- Smoother UX
- Lower gas spikes
- Lower latency

### Use Cases That Benefit
- Trading & execution engines  
- Gaming  
- Real-time bidding/auction logic  
- Payments & microtransactions
