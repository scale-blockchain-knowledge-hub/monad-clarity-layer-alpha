# Quick Developer Onboarding (Mental Model)

This card explains the “first hour” on Monad.

### Step 1: Understand the Performance Edge
Know when your app benefits from parallel execution.

### Step 2: Review Existing Solidity Contracts
Most will deploy with minimal changes.

### Step 3: Identify State Conflicts
Parallelization works best when users don't touch the same storage slots.

### Step 4: Plan Your First Micro-Project
Start with a simple, deterministic idea.

### Step 5: Validate Your Architecture
Use Idea Patterns (next card) to draft a high-level sketch.
