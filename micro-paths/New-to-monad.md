# Micro-Path 01 — New to Monad (30-Minute Primer)

This path is designed for developers who just discovered Monad and want a fast, 
clear understanding of what it is, why it matters, and what they can build.

---

## Step 1 — What is Monad? (5 mins)
Read:
- clarity-cards/01-what-is-monad.md

Focus:
- Monad = high-performance, EVM-compatible L1
- Reuses Solidity & tooling
- Breakthrough = parallel execution + deterministic scheduling

Insight:
You don’t need to learn a new language. Mental models carry over.

---

## Step 2 — How Monad Differs from Other EVM Chains (5 mins)
Read:
- clarity-cards/02-monad-vs-evm-chains.md

Focus:
- Parallel vs sequential execution
- Faster throughput
- Lower latency patterns
- Same EVM ecosystem, different performance layer

Exercise:
Explain Monad in 2 sentences to yourself.

---

## Step 3 — Parallel Execution in Simple Language (5 mins)
Read:
- clarity-cards/03-parallel-execution-simple.md

Focus:
- When transactions can run simultaneously
- How conflicts are resolved
- Why this matters for UX-heavy apps

Mental Model:
Think: “More users acting independently = more performance gain.”

---

## Step 4 — Performance Design & Use Cases (5 mins)
Read:
- clarity-cards/04-performance-design.md

Focus:
- What kinds of apps benefit: marketplaces, trading engines, games, microtransactions

Quick Check:
Does your app have independent user flows? If yes, Monad fits.

---

## Step 5 — Idea Patterns (5 mins)
Read:
- clarity-cards/07-idea-patterns.md

Pick 1–2 patterns that interest you:
- High-frequency apps
- Independent-user apps
- Compute-heavy, state-light apps

---

## Step 6 — Output (5 mins)
Write one line:

**“My first Monad idea is…”**

This completes the primer.
You now have enough context to ideate and explore deeper.
