# Micro-Path 02 — Hackathon Project Quickstart (45–60 mins)

This path is optimized for hackathon participants who need clarity fast.  
Goal: Generate a valid Monad-native idea and sketch its architecture within 1 hour.

---

## Step 1 — Monad Overview (5 mins)
Read:
- clarity-cards/01-what-is-monad.md

Understand:
- What Monad is optimized for
- Why performance is a differentiator

---

## Step 2 — Identify Your Advantage (5 mins)
Read:
- clarity-cards/03-parallel-execution-simple.md

Ask:
“Does my idea leverage parallelism, low latency, or high throughput?”

If no → pivot idea.
If yes → proceed.

---

## Step 3 — Explore High-Value Idea Patterns (10 mins)
Read:
- clarity-cards/07-idea-patterns.md

Choose 1–2 patterns:
- Parallel leaderboards
- Multi-auction engines
- Microtransaction flows
- Compute-heavy utilities
- Multi-user collaboration tools

---

## Step 4 — Review Micro Project Starters (10 mins)
Read:
- clarity-cards/10-micro-project-starters.md

Pick 1 starter that aligns with your skills.

Output:
Write 3 bullets describing your chosen idea.

---

## Step 5 — Create a Rough Architecture Sketch (10–15 mins)
Guiding Questions:
- What functions run independently?
- What storage variables could cause conflicts?
- How often do users write to the same state?
- Where does Monad’s parallelism give you an edge?

Add:
- Entry points
- Data flow
- Expected conflict patterns

---

## Step 6 — Validate with the Migration Checklist (5 mins)
Read:
- clarity-cards/09-migration-checklist.md

Tick:
- Zero new language / EVM-based
- Minimal conflicts
- Clear user flows
- Simple logic, tight scope

---

## Step 7 — Final Output (5 mins)
Write:

**Project Name:**  
**One-liner:**  
**Why Monad:**  
**Architecture Summary:**  
**User Flow:**  

Your hackathon-ready blueprint is done.
