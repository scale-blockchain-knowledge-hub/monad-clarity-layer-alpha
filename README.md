Scale is building an AI-native **learning + intelligence layer** to help Web3 developers understand 
and build on high-performance chains like Monad with clarity and speed.

This **pre-MVP prototype** distills Monad's core concepts into short, contextual “Clarity Cards” 
and 30–60 minute guided Micro-Paths. It also includes a lightweight intelligence layer to capture 
signals about what developers read, where they get stuck, and which questions repeat.

The goal: **accelerate developer onboarding** and enable builders to form strong mental models quickly.

## What’s inside this Prototype

### 1. Clarity Cards  
Short, AI-assisted explanations of key concepts:
- What Monad is  
- How it differs from other EVM chains  
- Why parallel execution matters  
- Developer workflow essentials  
- Common idea patterns  
- Security basics  
- Migration checklists  

### 2. Micro-Paths (Guided Learning)
Designed for:
- Developers discovering Monad for the first time  
- Hackathon participants  
- EVM devs exploring migration or optimization  
- Early builders drafting their first Monad project  

### 3. Intelligence Layer (Pre-MVP)
A minimal signal-capture mechanism:
- Thumbs-up / confused feedback  
- Short-form questions  
- Manual aggregation of learning friction points  

These signals help improve clarity and prioritize new learning modules.

## Vision

To build the **Clarity Layer for Web3**, starting with Monad — a high-performance, 
EVM-compatible chain redefining parallel execution.

This prototype will evolve into:
- AI-generated learning modules  
- Builder intelligence dashboards  
- Developer onboarding content for partners  
- Public micro-courses with interactive examples  

---

## Status

This is a **pre-MVP prototype**, under active development by Scale.
We will be open-sourcing more modules, examples, and interactive learning paths after Monad Blitz.
